Long time ago I had a blog. Then I had another one. Then I had made several wannabe blogs that never saw the light. At the end it always dies due to the lack of habit. This time I will try harder (but no promises given).

However one thing is sure and it begins with

# Hello World! #


```golang
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
```

This is `Hello World` written in `golang`. I think I hate `golang` but that's in what [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/ "A static site generator") is written in. And I chose to run this blog with it so I would give it some honor points in being useful for something.

> So farewell for now.
